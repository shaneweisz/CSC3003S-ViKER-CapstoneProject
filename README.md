# ViKER Capstone Project
(Note: we should look at https://dbader.org/blog/write-a-great-readme-for-your-github-project and https://github.com/dbader/readme-template for a README template)

## 1. Project Description

This capstone project is a component of a larger international project that Professor Maria Keet is working on. The goal of the larger project is to make database access more accessible to the average user and to reuse the conceptual model of the database at runtime. The component that this project will focus on is the transformation between an Extended Entity Relational Model (EER) and the Abstract Relational Model, which is the first step in creating this knowledge-to-data pipeline.

The tool has been made accessible for a user in the form of a well-designed user interface. This will allow future users to make easy use of the tool during implementation of the larger project. Some of the things the user can do with the tool is conversions between the two data models, generating and viewing reports of data model transformations, and loading and saving models.

## 2. Example Usage

### ARM Model Examples

Run `python3 arm_example.py` from within the src folder for an example that creates and instantiates a basic ARM Model for Movies and Actors.
